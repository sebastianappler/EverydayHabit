# Everyday Habit

## Introduction
Everyday Habit is a habit tracker that honors the idea to make habits permanent. 

When we promise ourselves to introduce a good habit in our life it's easy to fall into the trap of making it too hard.
The key is to trick the brain to make something easy every day that will give results in the long run. The minimum effort of every day must be low enough to complete the worst day of your life. You will soon realize you will often spend more time than the minimum effort anyway. As long as you do something every day you can be proud, you just did something that's infinite more than nothing. 

This app is a proof that this is working to some degree. I set myself the goal to make an app to keep track of my habits. I set my minimum effort to spend at least 2 minutes every day. If it worked I would have developed an app or if it wouldn't work, well I would at least not lose anything. But here we are!
